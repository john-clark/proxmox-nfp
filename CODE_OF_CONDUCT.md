# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This is a private individuals work, that is shared with the public. There is no community, if at such time there becomes one, this message may be revised then.

## Our Standards

We are busy and expect people to respect our time and effort. We are not getting paid for this and expectations should reflect that.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsiblities

All complaints will be reviewed although probably not promptly.

If we see fit we will act upon them or refer them to the appropriate authority.
